This project was created using a template that includes a basic setup for getting React functioning in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

You can install the npm with the follow command:
```
npm install
```

During the `install`, all necessary resources will be installed. Afterward, you can run the program with:
```
npm run dev
```
